# PRD: Marketplace for Cash-Generating Assets (ATMs, Vending Machines, etc.)

## 1. Overview
This platform is a **two-sided marketplace** enabling the buying, selling, and bidding of cash-producing fiscal assets such as ATM machines, vending machines, and similar automated revenue-generating equipment. The goal is to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient exchange where asset owners can liquidate or scale their businesses, and investors/operators can acquire proven income-producing assets.

- **Access for Buyers**: Allow individuals and businesses to acquire verified, income-producing machines.
- **Transparency**: Deliver key financial metrics (historical cash flow, location performance, service history).
- **Efficiency**: Enable bidding, direct purchases, and escrow-secured transactions.
- **Scalability**: Support expansion into additional asset categories (laundromats, car wash machines, kiosks).
